This is a program for educational purpose. I do this for to work the congruence in mathematics. *I'm not responsable for possible malicious uses of this program !*

The program is the implementation in C language of one algorithme for to find the RIB keys of a account with four informations : bank code, guichet code, the first and second part of  a account number.


For use this program you need a IDE or C compiler, you can use your own bank informations and you can make all modification that you want. You just must mention my name in your source code.
